            <p>The #1 bestselling JavaScript course on Udemy!</p>
            <p>Just updated with ES2024 and ES2025!</p>
            <p>"Really, really well made course. Super in-depth, with great challenges and projects that will solidify
                your
                Javascript understanding. I found the lectures were paced perfectly -- Jonas doesn't skip over anything
                that
                might be useful to a JS developer" — Carson Bartholomew</p>

            <p>This is the most complete and in-depth JavaScript course on Udemy (and maybe the entire internet!). It's
                an
                all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of JavaScript, all the way to building
                modern and complex applications.

                You will learn modern JavaScript from the very beginning, step-by-step. I will guide you through
                practical
                and fun code examples, important theory about how JavaScript works behind the scenes, and beautiful and
                complete projects.</p>

            <p>You will become ready to continue learning advanced front-end frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, or
                Svelte.

                You will also learn how to think like a developer, how to plan application features, how to architect
                your
                code, how to debug code, and a lot of other real-world skills that you will need in your developer job.
            </p>

            <p>By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your
                job
                interviews and become a professional developer.</p>

            <p>I know how students learn JavaScript and what they need in order to master it. And with that knowledge,
                I
                designed the ideal course curriculum. It's a unique blend of real-world projects, deep explanations,
                theory
                lectures, and challenges, that will take you from zero to an expert and confident JavaScript developer
                in
                just a couple of weeks.</p>

            <p>Hi, I'm Jonas! I'm one of Udemy's Top Instructors and all my premium courses have earned the best-selling
                status for outstanding performance and student satisfaction.

                I'm a full-stack web developer and designer with a passion for building beautiful web interfaces from
                scratch. I've been building websites and apps since 2010 and also have a Master's degree in Engineering.

                I discovered my passion for teaching and helping others by sharing everything I knew during college.
                This passion led me to Udemy in 2015, where I now have the privilege of training 2,000,000+ learners in
                the field of web development.



                These courses are exactly the courses I wish I had when I was first getting into web development!

                But see for yourself, enroll in one of my courses, and join 2,000,000+ happy students today.</p>
